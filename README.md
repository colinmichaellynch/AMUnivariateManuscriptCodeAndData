# AMUnivariateManuscriptCodeAndData

##  Abstract

Additive manufacturing (AM) presents engineering challenges that are not present in traditional manufacturing practices. The qualification of AM processes (such as laser-based powder bed fusion, PBF-LB/M) therefore requires a different set of standards from those currently used in practice. We propose a novel statistical approach for process qualification based on determining whether a part produced by a candidate process is equivalent to that produced by a stable reference process with respect to a single response variable. We couple this approach with an optimal sampling protocol to reduce the costs of experimentation.
